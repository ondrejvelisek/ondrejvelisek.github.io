# What is ondrejvelisek about?

Hi, I'm Ondrej Velisek, living in the Czech Republic.
I started programming in 2007—first games for fun, then backends for a while, but I fell in love with web frontend quickly.
I've worked at several companies and used a lot of technologies, but there is more I want you to know about me and my blog.

import aboutMeNatureUrl from './about_nature.webp';

This blog exists so I can present my personal opinions, which I believe aren't discussed enough elsewhere.
I also like to go deeper into topics.
So you won't find basic tutorials or rewritten tool documentation here.
I think there's plenty of that already.
I want to contribute to the community and help shape the future of the web,
even though I know I'm just a drop of water in the ocean of all other resources and opinions.
But after all, the ocean is just a collection of drops.

This means I write about things I want to see improved.
And I've found that, as a result, most of my articles contain some degree of negativity or criticism.
I apologize for that. I try really hard to always explain that it's not about criticizing,
but about changing the status quo.
Sometimes I succeed more, sometimes less.
But it's very important for me to let everyone know that
I appreciate every single technology and admire all the developers behind—especially those
who open-source their work and make it free to use. Thank you for your time and effort.


This approach also means I'm sometimes controversial. It seems not many people do that today.
I see a lot of blog posts that just repeat what others say and try to be neutral.
Maybe a lot of people are afraid of being rejected or being wrong.
Reading this blog, you might think I'm always controversial.
But if you met me in person, you'd see I'm actually quite a conservative person.
I just don't want to write about it.

I try to create the highest quality content I'm capable of. I don't use AI to write articles—I write them myself.
However, since I'm not a native English speaker, I do use AI to check grammar and rephrase some sentences.
I enjoy creating diagrams, charts, live examples, and code snippets.
I believe this makes my articles more interesting and easier to understand.

But it's worth mentioning here that I'm sometimes wrong. Sorry for that.
It's not because I don't do research before writing.
I usually spend hours and hours on research, and if possible, I try to use and test the technology myself.
But I simply can't be 100% sure about everything.
It's also because I choose non-standard topics, and I like to go deep.

I'm glad for your feedback and I try to listen and correct my mistakes as soon as possible.
When I find a mistake within a few days of publishing, I fix it.
When it's discovered later, I keep the original content and add an update note,
so that if the original content is referenced from somewhere outside, it is still available.
I have to say that my mistakes don't stop me. And I believe it's still beneficial to publish.
And if you're thinking of publishing yourself, and are afraid of being wrong, I encourage you to just do it.

That's what I want you to know about me and my blog. How I think about content creation.
And what you can find here.

Thank you for reading.
