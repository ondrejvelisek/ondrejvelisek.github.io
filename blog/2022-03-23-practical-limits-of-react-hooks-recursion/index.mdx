# Practical limits of React hooks - Recursion

While ago, I started using React hooks. The simplicity, homogenity and composability sounded great.
Both components and hooks are simple functions. I can easily react on state changes from memory, 
local storage, location URL and server the same way - with hooks. Mental model stays simple.
My app is just a big function which consumes state and produces DOM. This big function is composed 
of a smaller functions which are composed of smaller functions and so on. But there were obstacles 
I've started to encounter and in the end I hit the hard limit of React hooks.

> UPDATE 2024: new React [`use`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) hook may finally solve following limitation 
> (if you accept `<Suspense/>` as a good pattern)

## Model app

Each app has some data model defined with entities and relations between them. Lets say we have company 
Department and Employee where department consists of other departments and/or direct employees. 
One employee can directly work for exactly one department. Cycles in department hierarchy are prohibited.

Our Backend implements REST endpoints.

```code title="/departments"
returns list of all department ids
```

```code title="/departments/:departmentId"
returns list of sub-department ids
and list of direct employee ids
```

There are three product requirements.

## Pleasant walk with basic hooks

First product requirement is simple. User selects a department and wants to see number of direct employees.
Pfff, its simple. Just implement this custom hook which uses department REST endpoint and use it in a component.

```tsx
const useDirectEmployeeCount(
    departmentId: string
): number =>
    useDirectEmployeeIds(departmentId).length
```

```tsx
const useDirectEmployeeIds(
    departmentId: string
): Array<string> =>
    useDepartment(departmentId).directEmployeeIds
```

```tsx
const useDepartment(
    departmentId: string
): Department =>
    useQuery(
        ['departments', departmentId],
        () => fetch(`/departments/${departmentId}`)
    ).data
```

Our backend implements exactly this endpoints so we use `react-query` and we are done.
There are some loading and error states which I omitted, we can use fancy Suspend and ErrorBoundary,
but we understand the code.


## Obstacles with looping

Second product requirement is simple. User needs to select multiple departments and see sum of direct employees.
Ok, simple. I already have code for one. So simply loop it over multiple selected departments and sum the result.

```tsx
const totalCount = sum(
    departmentIds.map(
        departmentId => useDirectEmployeeCount(departmentId)
    )
)
```

Wait! It is a hook and there are rule of hooks. Anoying but still doable.
Lets reimplement `useDirectEmployeeCount` to support multiple department ids. 
Then I can sum them like this.

```tsx
const departmentCounts = useDirectEmployeeCount(departmentIds)
const totalCount = sum(departmentCounts)
```
```tsx
const useDirectEmployeeCount(
    departmentIds: Array<string>
): Array<number> =>
    useDirectEmployeeIds(departmentIds)
        .map(employeeIds => employeeIds.length)
```

But wait! I need to reimplement `useDirectEmployeeIds` too. Very anoying.

```tsx
const useDirectEmployeeIds(
    departmentIds: Array<string>
): Array<Array<string>> =>
    useDepartment(departmentIds)
        .map(department => department.directEmployeeIds)
```

But wait! Grrr...

```tsx
const useDepartment(
    departmentIds: Array<string>
): Array<Department> =>
    useQueries(departmentIds.map(departmentId => ({
        queryKey: ['departments', departmentId],
        queryFn: () => fetch(`/departments/${departmentId}`)
    })))
        .map(result => result.data)
```

Uf. Done. I'm glad it is a small project with just three hooks. Tell me the last requirement.

## Limits with recursion

Third and last product requirement is simple. User needs to select department and see sum of direct and
indirect employees (including employees from all sub-departments and their sub-departments and so on).
Ok, simple. I already have code for multiple departments. So simply recursively call it and sum the result.

```tsx
const useIndirectEmployeeCount(
    departmentIds: Array<string>
): Array<number> => {
    const directCount = useDirectEmployeeCount(departmentIds);
    const departments = useDepartment(departmentIds);
    const subDepartmentIds = departments.flatMap(department => department.subDepartmentIds);
    const indirectCount = useIndirectEmployeeCount(subDepartmentIds);
    return directCount + indirectCount
}
```

Wait.

Oh. You almost got me. I just forgot a recursive break, right?

```tsx
const useIndirectEmployeeCount(
    departmentIds: Array<string>
): Array<number> => {
    const directCount = useDirectEmployeeCount(departmentIds);
    const departments = useDepartment(departmentIds);
    const subDepartmentIds = departments.flatMap(department => department.subDepartmentIds);
    if (subDepartmentIds.length === 0) {
        return directCount;
    }
    const indirectCount = useIndirectEmployeeCount(subDepartmentIds);
    return directCount + indirectCount
}
```

Wait.

...

## Last words

Mental model stays simple. Everything is a simple function. My app is one big function composed of smaller and
smaller ones. It trully sounds great! But in a real world, hooks are not so simple, homogen and composable.
There are obstacles and limits mainly because of rule of hooks.

This post is not about saying React hooks are bad. I wrote it because I did not find any resources
on such obstacles and limits. The React world looks like hooks are always pleasant walk trought the rosy garden.
But they are not.

For now I don't know how to elegantly solve the recusrion example. Are there some resources on this?
Do you have following thougts? Maybe I'm not the only one struggling.

Thanks for reading.
